# Emulator-UPS

*The goal of my project is to simulate a ups system in Assembly Language Programming.
*The ups (uninterrupted power supply) system turns on automatically when there is a power cut.
*This system is only used for  essential home electronic resources  like  CFL bulbs,fan.Heavy loads are not runned in ups.
*The ups is charged when there is normal power supply until its battery is full. 
*This is a sequence of carefully timed series of ON and OFF signals that can also be called highand low pulses or digital zeros and ones.
